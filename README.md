Two days ago I started learning mongodb and with watching videos I was taking some notes to remember the commands
then I said to myself "hey why don't I share this notes on Github?"

Why not? [Here are some notes and tips to get started with mongodb](./mongo_commands.md)

To use [API](./api/):
- create a mongodb database and name it "mydb"
- add a collection with "docs" name
- use ` npm install ` or ` npm i ` command to install api dependencies
- you can import some examples documents to "docs" collection using to [JSON file](./mongodb%20collection/mydb.docs.json) in [mongodb collection folder](./mongodb%20collection/)
- if you're using Postman you can import [this JSON file](./postman/mydb.postman_collection.json) to test API in [postman folder](./postman/)
