Two days ago I started learning mongodb and with watching videos I was taking some notes to remember the commands
then I said to myself "hey why don't I share this notes on Github?"

So, why not? [Here are some notes and tips to get started with mongodb](./mongo_commands.md)

Btw if you want to watch the full tutorial on youtube [here is the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExcRbA7fy_A&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9h77dJ-QJlwGlZlTd4ecZOA&pp=iAQB)

To use [API](./api/) create a mongodb database and name it "mydb"  
also add a collection with "docs" name

You can import some examples documents to "docs" collection using to [JSON file](./mongodb%20collection/mydb.docs.json) in [mongodb collection folder](./mongodb%20collection/)

And if you're using Postman you can import [this JSON file](./postman/mydb.postman_collection.json) to test API in [postman folder](./postman/)
